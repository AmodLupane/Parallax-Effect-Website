            <p class="text">
                Activities that performed without thinking of the outcomes can be defined as an adventure. There is not a 
                definite definition of adventure.
                <br><br>
                Christy Raedeke said that “If there is no risk, there is no reward”. It refers that where is a bit of risk involved, 
                and only then there is a chance of getting a reward. Adventurous trips, a financial decision, starting a new venture, 
                quitting a job for chasing the passion, etc can be called as an adventure in general life. Adventure is giving a 
                self-inspired move from the regular days.

                One can use cycle as an exercise instrument or a vehicle. Thus, the pleasures included in cycling depend on the purpose. Irrespective of the purpose, there are some common pleasures such as feels of fresh air, newer scenes, relaxation of mind etc.
                <br><br>
                Cycling – its pleasures and advantages can also include some other factors. When we move on cycle to certain place, we find occasion to understand the olden times and natural features of that place. We can admit the fact that the one who uses cycle is richer than the one who uses a car.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is a sport in which the players fly in the air using paragliders. These paragliders are light in weight and are foot launched. There is a harness in the glider on which the paraglider sits. This harness is interconnected to the glider with baffled cells. We will learn various aspects of this adventurous in the chapters that follow.
                <br><br>
                Paragliding demands jumping from high heels and to ski in the air for long hours. Therefore, a hill station having a stiff peak and a wide area for surfing in the air will be a suitable environment. If it will be played in any normal crowded area, then it is obvious that the user will face difficulty while paragliding.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a water sport that involves planing, “in a controlled way,” on the sloping portion of a wave as it moves toward shore. The most basic form of the sport is body surfing. It is done without a board. A person first swims toward shore “to equal the wave speed.” Then the person stiffens the body in order to “plane” on the front of the wave. 
                <br><br>
                Surfing is becoming more popular each year. For safety, new surfers must be good swimmers. Boards should be checked for cracks and slivers before each use. All surfers should check the water conditions posted at the life guard station before entering the water. Surfing should only be done during the daylight hours and when other people are present
